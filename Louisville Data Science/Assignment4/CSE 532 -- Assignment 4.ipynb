Choose one of the [toy classification datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html) bundled with sklearn **other than the digits dataset**. <br> b. Train **three** distinct sklearn classification estimators for the chosen dataset and compare the results to see which one performs the best when using **2-fold cross-validation**.  Note that you should use three distinct classification models here (not just tweak underlying parameters).  A relatively complete listing of the available estimators can be found here (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) -- but make sure you only use classifiers!  Unless you have an inclination to do otherwise, I recommend using the model default parameters when available.   <br> c. Repeat a. for **20-fold cross-validation**. Explain in a paragraph the difference in your results when using 20-fold vs 2-fold cross-validation (if any). <br>d. Construct a **confusion matrix** for your _most accurate_ model between the three estimators and two cross-fold options. <br> e. Which class in your dataset is most accurately predicted to have the correct label by the best classifier, and and which is most likely to be confused among one or more of the wrong classes?_(You can use a cell in a jupyter notebook file for this or a separate text/document file)._"

    "**Difference in your results when using 20-fold vs 2-fold cross-validation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like both of sets of results when using the different number of cross-validation folds actually showed the same classifier order with regards to model accuracy (LRC > KNN > DTC). However, you can easily see that with more cross validation folds the arrays of accuracies seems to average out more (subsequent runs give around the same average acccuracy for the three models). A higher number of cross validation folds allows us to better predict how the model would perform with regards to different training and testing data subsets, giving us a better idea on how the model would actual perform on \"new\" and different testing data. Often, every bit of the training dataset will be used to train an actual model, leaving the model architect with the choice to use cross validation to find the optimal paramerters which give the model its best validation accuracy. Overall 20-fold cross validation gives us a better idea of how the model performs based on 20 different training and validation data splits, while 2-fold cross validation only provides us with 2 different training and validation splits leaving us with more model accuracy variation upcome consecutive executions."

    "\n",
    "Class 0 is much more likely to be accurately predicted to have the correct label by my trained logistic regression classifier because it has been correctly classified 100% of the time and misclassified 0% of the time, it seems like class 0 has vastly different attributes when compared to the other two classes of iris flower types. Class 1 is the mostly likely class to be misclassified, in this case 3 samples (out of 50) were misclassified as class 2 when they actual were class 1 samples. However, it is tough to argue which class (class 1 or class 2) is misclassified the most because of the very small amount of samples that are available to validate with. I also think it is important to point out that class 1 samples and class 2 samples must have similar attributes to eachother because their misclassification trends specifically point to the opposing class.\n"

Furthermore, if you want to emphasize the impact of outliers within your dataset when testing your model you would utilize the MSE metric, but if you wanted outliers to not have as much impact on your model's performance then you should utilize the R-squared metric. Overall, it is often beneficial to consider both metrics when analyzing a model.\n",
