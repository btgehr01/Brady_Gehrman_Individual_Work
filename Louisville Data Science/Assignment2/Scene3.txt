Chief?

There's something you need to see.

Our traps in the east lagoon...

they're pulling up less and less fish.

Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

We have.

There's no fish.

Oh.

Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

We tried.

The windward side.

And the leeward side, the shallows, the channel.

We've tried the whole lagoon.

They're just gone.

Have you tried using a different bait?

I don't think it's the bait.

There's no fish.

It seems like it's getting worse and worse.

Of course, I understand you have reason for concern.

I will talk to the council.

I'm sure we..

What if we fish beyond the reef?

No one goes beyond the reef.

I know.

But if there are no fish inthelagoon“.

- Moana.

- And there's a whole ocean.

We have one rule.

An old rule, when there were fish.

- A rule that keeps us safe...

- But Dad, I...

...instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water.

Every time I think you're past this...

No one goes beyond the reef!

Well, it's not like you said it in front of your dad.

Standing on a boat.

I didn't say go beyond the reef, because I want to be on the ocean.

But you still do.

- He's hard on you because...

- Because he doesn't get me.

Because he was you.

Drawn to the ocean.

Down by the shore.

He took a canoe, Moana.

He crossed the reef...

and found an unforgiving sea.

Waves like mountains.

His best friend begged to be on that boat.

Your dad couldn't save him.

He's hoping he can save you.

Sometimes...

who we wish we were, what we wish we could do...

it's just not meant to be.

I've been staring at the edge of the water Long as I can remember Never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water No matter how hard I try Every turn I take Every trail I track Every path I make Every road leads back To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me One day I'll know If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on this island Has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride I can make us strong I'll be satisfied If I play along But the voice inside Sings a different song What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea It's blinding But no one knows How deep it goes And it seems like it's calling out to me So come find me And let me know What's beyond that line Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea It calls me And no one knows How far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know How far I'll go Whoa.

We're okay, Pua.

I can do this.

There's more fish beyond the reef.

There's more beyond the reef.

Not so bad.

Pua!

Whatever "gust happened...

blame it on the pig.

Gram ma.

Are you gonna tell Dad?

I'm his mom.

I don't have to tell him anything.

He was right.

About going out there.

It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

Okay.

Well, then, head on back.

Put that stone up there.

Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

You said that's what you wanted.

It is.

When I die...

I'm going to come back as one of these.

Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

Why are you acting weird?

I'm the village crazy lady.

That's my job.

If there's something you want to tell me, just tell me!

Is there something you wanna tell me?

Is there something you want to hear?

You've been told all our people's stories...

but one.

What is this place?

Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef?

What's in there?

The answer to the question you keep asking yourself.

Who are you meant to be?

Go inside...

bang the drum...

and find out.

Whoa.

Oh.

Bang the drum.

We read the wind and the sky When the sun is high We sail the length of the seas On the ocean breeze At night we name every star We know where we are We know who we are Who we are We set a course to find A brand new island everywhere we roam We keep our island in our mind And when it's time to find home We know the way We are explorers reading every sign We tell the stories of our elders In a never-ending chain We know the way We were voyagers.

We were voyagers!

We were voyagers!

We were voyagers!

We were voyagers!

Why'd we stop?

Maui.

When he stole from the mother island, darkness fell.

Te Ké awoke.

Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back.

To protect our people, the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

and now we have forgotten who we are.

And the darkness has continued to spread...

chasing away our fish...

draining the life...

from island after island.

Our island.

But, one day...

someone will journey beyond our reef, find Maui...

deliver him across the great ocean...

to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

I was there that day.

The ocean chose you.

I thought it was a dream.

N0pe!

Our ancestors believed Maui lies there...

at the bottom of his hook.

Follow it, and you will find him.

But why would it choose me?

I don't even know how to make it past the reef.

But I know who does!

- The crops are turning black.

- What about the fish?

This is happening all over the island.

- Please, please settle down.

- What are you going to do?

We will dig new fields.

We will find a way to...

We can stop the darkness!

Save our island!

There's a cavern of boats.

Huge canoes.

We can take them, find Maui, make him restore the heart.

We were voyagers.

We can voyage again!

You told me to help our people.

This is how we help our people.

Dad?

What are you doing?

I should've b*rned those boats a long time ago!

No!

DoNU We have to find Maui.

We have to restore the heart!

There is no heart!

This is just a rock!

No!

Chief!

It's your mother!

Mother...

What can be done?

Go.

Gram ma.

Go.

Not now.

I can't.

You must!

The ocean chose you.

Follow the fish hook.

Gramma...

And when you find Maui...

you grab him by the ear.

You say...

"I am Moana of Motunui.

"You will board my boat...

"sail across the sea...

"and restore the heart of Te Fiti." I can't leave you.

There is nowhere you could go that I won't be with you.

Go!
