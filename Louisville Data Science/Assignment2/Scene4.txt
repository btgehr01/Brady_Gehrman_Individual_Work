There's a line where the sky meets the sea And it calls me But no one knows How far it goes All that time wondering where I need to be ls behind me I'm on my own To worlds unknown Every turn I take Every trail I track Is a choice I make Now I can't turn back from the great unknown Where I go alone Where I long to be See her light up the night in the sea She calls me And yes, I know That I can go There's a moon in the sky And the wind is behind me Soon I'll know How far I'll go I am Moana of Motunui.

You will board my boat...

sail across the sea and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

I am Moana...

of Mom...

...nui.

Heihei?

It's okay.

You're all right.

See?

There we go.

Nice water.

The ocean is a friend of mine.

Heihei?

Heihei!

Sta)'- Okay.

Next stop, Maui.

I am Moana of Motunui.

You will board my boat...

sail...

across the sea...

and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

I am Moana of Motu...

Board my boat!

Oh, no.

No,no,no!

Ocean...

can I get a little help?

No, no.

Please.

Come on!

Help me!

Please!

And wrecking my boat?

Not helping!

Fish pee in you all day!

So...

You will board my boat.

No.

You will board my boat.

Yeah.

I am Moana of Motunui.

You will board my...

Boat!

A boat!

The gods have given me a...

Maui, shapeshifter...

demigod of the wind and sea...

- I am Moana of...

- Hero of men.

What?

It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter, demigod of the wind and sea...

hero of men.

I interrupted.

From the top.

Hero of men.

Go.

I am...

Sorry, sorry, SOFFY- And women.

Men and women.

Both.

All.

Not a guy, girl thing.

You know, Maui is a hero to all.

You're doing great.

What?

No!

I'm here to...

Of course.

Yes, yes, yes.

Maui always has time for his fans.

When you use a bird to write with...

it's called tweeting.

I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.

You are not my hero.

And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!

I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

And you will board my boat...

and sail across the sea and put it back!

Yeah, it almost sounded like you don't like me...

which is impossible because...

I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

trying to get the heart as a gift for you mortals.

So you could have the power to create life itself.

Yeah.

So, what I believe you were trying to say...

is "thank you."

-"Thank you?"

- You're welcome.

What?

No, no, no!

I didn't...

I wasn't...

Why would I ever say that?

Okay, Okay- I see what's happening Yeah You're face to face with greatness and it's strange You don't even know how you feel It's adorable Well it's nice to see that humans neverchange Open your eyes Let's begin Yes, it's really me It's Maui Breathe it in I know it's a lot The hair The bod When you're staring at a demigod What can I say except You're welcome For the tides, the sun, the sky Hey, it's okay, it's okay You're welcome I'm just an ordinary demiguy Hey!

Hey!

You lying, slimy son of a...

You're welcome You're so welcome.

No.

I'm not going to Te Fiti with some kid.

I'm going to get my hook.

You have yours and I'm not Maui without mine.

Okay, talk to the back.

Boat snack.

Good riddance, you filthy pile of pebbles.

Oh, no, no, no.

Don't look at me like that.

It's a beautiful cave.

She's gonna love it.

And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

I could watch that all day.

Okay.

Enjoy the island.

Maui, out.

No!

Stop!

Hey!

You have to put back the heart!

Did not see that coming.

I am Moana of Motunui.

This is my canoe...

and you will journey to...

All right, get over it.

We gotta move.

And she's back.

I am Moana of Motunui...

It was Moana, right?

Yes.

And you will restore the heart!

All right.

I'm out.

Oh, come on!

What is your problem?

Are you afraid of it?

No!

No.

I'm not afraid.

Stay out of it or you're sleeping in my armpit.

You, stop it.

That is not a heart.

It is a curse.

The second I took it, I got blasted outta the sky...

and I lost my hook.

Get it away from me.

Get this away?

Hey, hey, hey!

I'm a demigod, okay?

Stop that.

I will smite you!

You wanna get smote?

Smotten?

Listen, that thing doesn't give you power to create life...

it's a homing beacon of death.

If you don't put it away, bad things are gonna come for it.

Come for this?

The heart?

You mean this heart right here?

Don't, you can't raise your voice like that!

Come and get it!

You are gonna get us k*lled!

No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti, so you can put it back.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

Kakamora.

Kaka-what?

m*rder little pirates.

Wonder what they're here for.

They're kinda cute.

Ocean!

Do something!

Help us!

The ocean doesn't help you, you help yourself!

Tighten the halyard.

Bind the stays!

You can't sail?

I am self-taught.

Can't you shapeshift or something?

Do you see my hook?

No magic hook, no magic powers!

Their boat is turning into more boats!

Yep, I just did that.

No, no!

Heihei!

Maui!

They took the heart!

That's a chicken.

The heart is in the...

We have to get him back!

Maui!

Cheeeehoooo!

There!

Right there!

You're turning?

What are you doing?

Escaping!

The heart!

Forget it!

You'll never get it back!

Besides, you got a better one.

Hey!

What am I gonna steer with?

They're just gonna k*ll ya!

Coconuts.

Got it!

Hey!

Yeah!

We did it!

Congratulations on not being dead, girlie.

You surprise me.

But I'm still not taking that thing back.

You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta go through a whole ocean of bad.

Not to mention Te Ké.

Lava monster?

Ever defeat a lava monster?

No.

Have you?

I'm not going on a su1c1de mission with some mortal.

You can't restore the heart without me...

and me says no.

I'm getting my hook.

End of discussion.

You'd be a hero.

That's what you're all about, right?

Little girl, I am a hero.

Maybe you were.

But now...

now you're just the guy who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

The guy who cursed the world.

You're no one's hero.

No one?

But...

put this back...

save the world...

you'd be everyone's hero.

Maui!

Maui!

Maui!

You're so amazing!

We'd never make it without my hook.

Not past Te Ké.

Then we get your hook.

We get your hook, take out Te Ké, restore the heart.

Unless you don't wanna be...

Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

Hero to...

all.

First, we get my hook.

Then save the world.

Deal?

Deal.

Worth a sh*t.

Okay, we go east.

To the lair of Tamatoa.

If anyone has my hook, it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.
