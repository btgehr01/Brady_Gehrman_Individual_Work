Brady Gehrman CSE 532 Assignment #2

A. I chose the Disney Movie "Moana" as my movie. This movie includes 8 different scenes, and the script is saved within "Moana.txt". 

B. To load all of the different words used within the movie script into a python list simply run the code segment under part B within the CSE_532_Assignment_2.ipynb notebook located within this zip file. The Moana.txt file should be included within the same directory as the .ipynb file. The list is named "list_of_words_from_movie_script" and is displayed in the output. Each word in the list has no punctuation and is converted to lowercase.

C. To generated the two-column pandas data-frame simply run the code segment located under part c inside of the .ipynb file. The dataframe is named "df" and is displayed in the output.

D. To generate the pandas data-frame that doesn't include any "stop-words" and is sorted in decreasing order, you will need to run each code segment under part d sequentially. The generated pandas data-frame is named "df_without_stop_words" and is displayed in the output.

E. Each part included within part E of the assignment has its own code segment located below part E inside of the .ipynb file.

Part 1: variable "top_six_words" is a list of the top 6 most occuring words inside of my movie script.
Part 2: variable "word_frequencies_per_narrative" is a 2-d array that includes an array for each "top-occuring" word; therefore, we have six arrays within this 2-d array, and 8 elements within each sub-array (8 scenes within the movie). The 8 scenes within the movie each have a text file located within this zip_file (Scene1.txt, .... , Scene8.txt)
Part 3: By runnung the third code segment you can see the 2 x 3 series of subplots. Each word frequency per scene is shown as a percentage, and there is a subplot for each "top-occuring" word (hence the titles of each subplot).
