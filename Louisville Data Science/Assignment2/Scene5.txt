Teach me to sail.

My job is to deliver Maui across the great ocean.

I should...

I should be sailing.

It's called wayfinding, princess.

And it's not just sails and knots...

it's seeing where you're going in your mind.

Knowing where you are...

by knowing where you've been.

Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

I am the daughter of the chief.

- Same difference.

- No.

If you wear a dress, and you have an animal sidekick...

you're a princess.

You are not a wayfinder.

You will never be a wayfinder, you will never be a...

Really?

Blow dart in my butt cheek?

You are a bad person.

If you can talk, you can teach.

Wayfinding.

Lesson one.

Hit it.

Pull the sheet.

Not the sheet.

No.

Nope.

Nope.

No.

Tried that one already.

You're measuring the stars, not giving the sky a high-five.

If the current's warm, you're going the right way.

It's cold.

Wait, it's getting warmer.

That is disgusting!

What is wrong with you?

We're here?

See, told you I could do it!

Motunui?

I'm home?

- Moana!

- Dad?

Moana!

Mom?

Help!

No!

Moana!

Enjoy your beauty rest?

You know, a real wayfinder never sleeps...

so they actually get where they need to go.

Muscle up, buttercup.

We're here.

You're sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

Tamatoa?

Oh, he'll have it.

He's a scavenger.

Collects stuff.

Thinks it makes him look cool.

And for Tamatoa, trust me...

my hook is the coolest collectible.

And he lives up there?

No,no,no.

That's just the entrance...

to Lalotai.

Lalotai?

Realm of monsters?

We're going to the realm of monsters?

We?

No.

Me.

You are gonna stay here with the other chicken.

That's what I'm talking about.

Gimme some.

Come on.

That was a good one.

How do you not get it?

I called her a chicken, there's a chicken on the boat.

I know she's human, but that's not the...

You know what?

Forget it.

Forget it!

I'm not explaining it to you.

'Cause then it's not funny.

So, daughter of the chief...

I thought you stayed in the village.

You know, kissing babies and things.

Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

why your people decided to send...

How do I phrase this?

You.

My people didn't send me.

The ocean did.

The ocean?

Makes sense.

You're what, eight?

Can't sail.

Obvious choice.

It chose me for a reason.

If the ocean's so smart...

why didn't it just take the heart back to Te Fiti itself?

Or bring me my hook?

The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

You're the Chosen One!

The ocean chose you for a reason.

If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

So, not seeing an entrance.

Yes, because it only appears...

after a human sacrifice.

Kidding.

So serious.

Don't worry...

it's a lot farther down than it looks.

Cheeeehoooo!

I am still falling!

You can do this.

Go!

And he sticks the landing.

What?

Dum-dum, she's not even here.

No mortal's gonna jump into the realm of...

Huh?

Well, she's dead.

Okay, let's get my hook.

Maui's fishhook!

Yeah!

Sorry!

I thought you were a monster...

But I found your hook.

And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure.

Sta)'- What?

No.

I'm the one who found...

Listen.


For a thousand years...

I've only been thinking of keeping this hair silky...

getting my hook...

and being awesome again.

And it's not getting screwed up by a mortal...

who has no business inside of a monster cave, except...

Except...

maybe as bait.

Huh?

Wow!

The shiny, glittery cave.

And just like me...

it is covered in sparkly treasure.

Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

You're not selling it!

This is stupid!

I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

You go up there, he will k*ll you.

Just stick to the plan.

When he shows up, keep him distracted.

Make him talk about himself.

He loves bragging about how great he is.

You two must get along swell.

No, not since I ripped off his leg.

You ripped off his...

Maui?

What have we here?

It's a sparkly, shiny...

Wait a minute.

It's a human!

What are you doing down here, in the realm of the...

Just pick an eye, babe.

I can't concentrate on what I'm saying if you keep...

Yeah, pick one, pick one!

You're a funny-looking little thing, aren't you?

Don't!

That's my gramma's!

"That's my gramma's!" I ate my gramma!

And it took a week, 'cause she was absolutely humongous.

Why are you here?

'Cause you're amazing!

And we mortals have heard of the tale of the crab who became a legend!

And I just had to know...

how you became so...

crabulous?

Are you just trying to get me to talk about myself?

Because if you are...

I will gladly do so.

Huh?

In song form!

Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam I was a drab little crab once Now I know I can be happy as a clam Because I'm beautiful, baby And did your granny say Listen to your heart Be who you are on the inside I need three words To tear her argument apart Your granny lied I'd rather be shiny Like a treasure From a sunken pirate wreck Scrub the deck And make it look shiny I will sparkle like a Wealthy woman's neck Just a sec Don't ya know Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb They chase anything that glitters Beginners Oh, and here they come, come, come To the brightest thing that glitters Mm, fish dinners I just love free food And you look like seafood Hey, crab cake!

I'm back.

It's Maui Time!

What do you say, little buddy?

Giant hawk?

Coming up!

Cheeeehoooo!

Cheeeehoooo!

Well, well, well.

Little Maui's having trouble with his look Ya little semi-demi-mini-god Ouch What a terrible performance Get the hook Get it?

You don't swing it Like you used to, man Yet I have to give you Credit for my start And your tattoos on the outside For just like you I made myself a work of art I'll never hide I can% I'm too shiny Watch me dazzle Like a diamond in the rough Strut my stuff My stuff is so shiny Send your armies But they'll never be enough My shell's too tough Maui, man You can try, try, try But you can't expect a demigod To b*at a decapod Look it up You Will die, die, die Now it's time for me to take apart Your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you Chasing the love of these humans Who made you feel wanted You tried to be tough But your armor's just not hard enough Maui Now it's time to kick your heinie Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'Cause it's the last you'll ever see C'est la vie Mon ami I'm so shiny Now I eat you so prepare your final plea Just for me You'll never be quite as shiny You wish you were nice and shiny - Hey!

- Huh?

I got something shiny for ya!

The heart of Te Fiti.

You can't run from me!

Oh, you can.

You keep surprising me.

There's only so far you can get on those two little legs.

The power of creation...

for a crustacean.

Where is it?

Where is it?

We gotta go!

What about the heart?

He can have it.

I've got a better one.

Yes, I have the...

Wait a minute.

I see, she's taken a barnacle and she's covered it in...

bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

Come back here!

Cheeeehoooo!

Hey!

Did you like the song?

We're alive!

Listen...

- I appreciate what you did down there.

- Mm-hmm.

- Took guts.

- Mm-hmm.

- But“ - Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry.

I'm trying to be sincere for once, and it feels like you're distracted.

No, no.

No way!

Really?

Because you're looking at me like I have a...

shark head.

What?

Do you have a shark head?

Look, the point is...

for a little girl, child, thing, whatever...

who had no business being down there...

you did me a solid.

But you also almost d*ed.

And I couldn't even b*at that dumb crab.

So, chances of b*ating Te Ké?

Bupkis.

We're never making it to Te Fiti.

This mission is cursed.

It's not cursed.

Shark head.

It is not cursed.

Cursed.

What can I say except We're dead soon We're dead soon Can you at least try?

Giant hawk.
