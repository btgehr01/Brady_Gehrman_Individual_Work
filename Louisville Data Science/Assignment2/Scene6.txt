Hey, it's okay, it's okay We're dead soon All right, break time's over.

Get up.

Why?

Are you gonna give me a speech?

Tell me I can b*at Te Ka 'cause I'm "Maui?" Take a hike, Tiny.

How do you get your tattoos?

They show up.

When I earn them.

How'd you earn that one?

What's that for?

That's man's discovery of Nunya.

What's Nunya?

Nunya business.

I'll just keep asking.

What's it for?

You need to stop doing that.

- Back off.

- Just tell me what it is.

I said back off.

Is it why your hook's not working?

You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

You wanna throw me off the boat...

throw me off.

You wanna tell me I don't know what I'm doing...

I know I don't.

I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

You're right.

But my island is dying...

so I am here.

It's just me and you.

And I want to help...

but I can't if you don't let me.

I wasn't born a demigod.

I had human parents.

They took one look and decided...

they did not want me.

They threw me into the sea...

like I was nothing.

Somehow, I was found by the gods.

They gave me the hook.

They made me...

Maui.

And back to the humans I went.

I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

Anything they could ever want.

You took the heart for them.

You did everything for them.

So they'd love you.

It was never enough.

Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved.

But the gods aren't the ones who make you Maui.

You are.

Okay, Okay- I love you, too, buddy.

Cheeeehoooo!

Yeah!

Next stop, Te Fiti.

What?

I figured it out.

You know, the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands...

'cause your ancestors would sail her seas and find 'em.

All those new lands, new villages.

It was the water that connected 'em all.

And if I were the ocean...

I think I'd be looking for a curly-haired non-princess...

to start that again.

That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti.

I did.

Moana of Motunui...

I believe you have officially delivered Maui across the great sea.

Moana!

Moana!

Moana!

You're so amazing!

It's time.

Go save the world.

Cheeeehoooo!

Maui!

What are you doing?

Finding you a better way in!

- We won't make it!

- Yes, we will!

- Turn around!

- No!

Moana, stop!

No!

Are you okay?

Maui?

I told you to turn back.

I thought we could make it.

We?

I thought I could make it.

We can fix it.

It was made by the gods.

You can't fix it!

Next time we'll be more careful.

Te KÃ© was stuck on the barrier islands.

It's lava, it can't go in the water.

We can find a way around.

I'm not going back.

We still have to restore the heart.

My hook is cracked.

One more hit, and it's over.

Maui, you have to restore the heart.

Without my hook, I am nothing.

That's not true!

Without my hook, I am nothing!

We are only here...

because you stole the heart in the first place.

No, we're here because the ocean told you you're special...

and you believed it.

I am Moana of Motunui.

- You will board my boat...

- Goodbye, Moana.

...sail across the sea...

I'm not k*lling myself...

so you can prove you're something you're not!

...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

The ocean chose me!

It chose wrong.

Maui!

Why did you bring me here?

I'm not the right person.

You have to choose someone else.

Choose someone else.

Please.

No.

You're a long ways past the reef.

Gram ma?

Guess I chose the right tattoo.

Gramma!

I tried, Gramma.

I couldn't do it.

It's not your fault.

I never should have put so much on your shoulders.

If you are ready to go home...

I will be with you.

Why do you hesitate?

I don't know.

I know a girl from an island She stands apart from the crowd She loves the sea and her people She makes her whole family proud Sometimes the world seems against you The journey may leave a scar But scars can heal and reveal just Where you are The people you love will change you The things you have learned will guide you And nothing on earth can silence The quiet voice still inside you And when that voice starts to whisper Moana, you've come so far Moana, listen Do you know who you are?

Who am I?

I am a girl who loves my island And the girl who loves the sea It calls me I am the daughter of the village chief We are descended from voyagers Who found their way across the world They call me I've delivered us to where we are I have journeyed farther I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me And the call isn't out there at all It's inside me It's like the tide Always falling and rising I will carry you here in my heart You remind me That come what may I know the way I am Moana I am Moana of Motunui.

Aboard my boat...

I will sail across the sea...

and restore the heart of Te Fiti.
